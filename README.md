#DecaDuino

DecaDuino is an Arduino library which provides a driver for the DecaWave DW1000
transceiver, and modules based on this transceiver, such as DecaWave DWM1000.
Since the DecaWave DW1000/DWM1000 is based on a Ultra Wide Band (UWB) Physical
layer, DecaDuino can be used as an open framework for wireless Time-of-Flight
(ToF) ranging systems.
